Create a symbolic link myfile13.txt in the watched directory to /tmp/myfile1.txt.
 Modify the file /tmp/myfile1.txt (its content). Did the monitor.c program reported 
 an event for myfile13.txt? Justify your answer and add it to ex1.txt.

Answer: The monitor.c program reported the creation of the symbolic link myfile13.txt
but did not report any modification event for myfile13.txt when /tmp/myfile1.txt was modified.
This is because inotify watches the symlink itself, not the file it points to. Modifications
to the target file do not reflect as events for the symbolic link.

Remove all duplicates of hard links to myfile11.txt only in the watched directory.
 fter this, print the stat info of the kept hard link. Check the number of hard links and explain the difference.

Answer: After removing duplicates, only myfile11.txt remains. The inode number remains the same, 
indicating it's still the same file, but the link count decreases as each hard link is removed. 
This is because hard links are directory entries for the same inode. Removing a hard link decreases
the link count but does not delete the file content unless the link count reaches zero.
