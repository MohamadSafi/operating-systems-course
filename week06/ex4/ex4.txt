The round-robin (RR) scheduling algorithm is a pre-emptive algorithm that cycles through all the processes in the system on a regular interval, the time quantum. When a process's time quantum expires, the next process in the queue is allocated the CPU. If a process finishes its execution before its quantum expires, the CPU scheduler will switch to the next process in the queue.

Comparing the outputs of all the exercises:
1. FCFS: Simple and predictable but can lead to the convoy effect.
2. SJF: Can lead to the shortest average waiting time, but risks starving longer processes.
3. RR: Provides a good balance between short and long processes, ensuring that all get a fair share of the CPU. However, the performance is highly dependent on the time quantum chosen.

For interactive systems, RR can be more suitable as it ensures responsiveness for all processes, but choosing an appropriate time quantum is critical.
